        <p>The orignal photo needed a good amount of editing. First, there was a lot of glare and reflections, so I adjusted the shadows, blacks, whites, contrast, and brightness. This helped me to get a darker image and reduce the reflections in the vending machince screen without tarnishing the quality of the image. Next, I noticed that beacuse of the reflective nature or the glass, I was getting a lot of double images. My first adjustments took care of some of it, but I still was not satisfied. So, I increased the clarity to make the objects more distinct. At this point, I was satisfied with how the picture looked; all that was left was to add in the blur. I played around with the iris blur for a bit until I knew exactly what I wanted to do. I used two iris blurs to direct the conentration in sort of a straight line, rounded at the ends, creating the effect of a blur at top and bottom of the vending machines.</p>
