		<p>D'Aundre Doris<br>I want to explore areas of pop culture and portray them in ways many people can admire, respect, and find beauty in. I want to create/edit images that people would want to have on their phone, memes that would make them laugh, clips that they would want to watch and rewatch daily, and websites that would open their creative minds and inspire them to make their own. I want make avenues for introverted people like myself to put themselves out from. All in all, I want make something that someone, anyone can enjoy.</p>
